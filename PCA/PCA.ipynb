    "3. Multiply a vector by $\\Sigma$\n",
    "    - Why? The proof in the notes show that $\\Sigma$ is the principal eigenvalue. (The eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of largest magnitude is called the principal eigenvector) \n",
    "    - slope of vector is converging to something. if u look carefully, that is the dimension where the data points seem to be spread out the most or (iow) of the greatest variance\n",
